Docker + Asp.Net + App Engine

Easy instructions on deploying a dockerized asp.net core project to Google App Engine.
This assumes you already have an empty App Engine project set up & a .net core app ready to go.

Make sure gCloud is installed
	download sdk : https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install
	cd into folder with install
	run: 
		tar xvzf google-cloud-sdk-VERSION-darwin-x86_64.tar
		cd google-cloud-sdk
		./install.sh

Publish your .net app 
	cd into your project folder
	dotnet publish -c Release

Test your .net app (I mean, you should anyway...) Because of the way Docker will connect to App Engine, you can't test once you dockerize. You'll just get "localhost could not be found" errors.


from you project's main folder, cd into your publish folder.
should be something like this: 
cd bin/Release/netcoreapp3.1/publish/

Create a new Dockerfile 
Add this to the file: 
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:3.1
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 8080
ENV ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://*:8080
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "Whateveryounamedyourapp.dll"]


Add a .dockerignore (if you want)
# comment
*/temp*
*/*/temp*
temp?


Add a new app.yaml 
Add this to the file: 
runtime: custom
env: flex

Run the following to make sure docker build completes (we're just testing for build completion):
docker build .

Run and follow the instructions: 
gcloud init 
Make sure you're still in the same folder as your app.yaml, run:
gcloud app deploy app.yaml
it'll take awhile to do it's thing. When prompted run: 
gcloud app browse

yay it's live! :)
